# Visual assets (guidance + placeholders)

This doc exists so the **Visual selector** step can recommend consistent visuals without inventing brand assets.

## Visual posture (matches voice)

- Minimal, calm, high-contrast, readable.
- No “panic graphics” (red sirens, flames, hack skull imagery).
- Prioritize usefulness: checklists, simple diagrams, short quotes.

## Allowed visual formats (default)

- **Checklist card**: 3–5 bullets, one clear headline.
- **Quote card**: one sentence + attribution (if internal/public figure).
- **Simple diagram**: custody model explained (exchange custody vs self-custody) using neutral shapes.

## Disallowed formats (default)

- Fear-mongering “breaking news” style cards.
- Shaming screenshots of victims or exchanges.
- Overly meme-y templates in crisis moments.

## Asset families (fill in when you add real assets)

If you later add actual image files, document them here and keep the names stable so prompts can reference them.

- **Logo / wordmark**:
  - `self-custody-check/public/brand/casa-wordmark.svg`
  - `self-custody-check/public/brand/casa-wordmark.png`
  - `self-custody-check/public/brand/casa-icon.jpeg`
- **Color palette**: (path TBD)
- **Typography**: (path TBD)
- **Background textures / patterns**: (path TBD)

## Visual selector decision rules

- **Crisis post on X**: default to **no visual** unless a checklist card materially improves clarity.
- **Educational thread**: checklist card works well.
- **Blog**: hero image optional; avoid sensational visuals; simple header graphic is fine.

## Visual prompt stub (for future)

If you later generate visuals, keep prompts aligned with:
- calm, institutional, minimal style
- large text, scannable
- no fear imagery
