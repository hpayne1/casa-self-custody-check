# Competitors, peers, and resources (for CASA context)

This doc supports:
- the **Assigner** (understanding category + positioning)
- the **Educational curator** (resource roundups)
- “Ahrefs-style authority” (helpful to the ecosystem, not salesy)

## How others often respond in crisis (pattern, not dunking)

In exchange hacks/failures, the best-in-class pattern (what we should emulate) tends to be:
- Empathy first, no “told you so”
- Explain custody plainly
- Offer safe next steps
- Avoid naming/shaming (unless you’re reporting facts neutrally)

What to avoid (common crypto failure modes):
- Fear-mongering and urgent CTAs
- Opportunistic ads / keyword targeting
- Blame, mockery, or tribal pile-ons

## Authority content angles (Ahrefs/ClickUp style)

### “Hard conversations” library
- How to talk to family about moving from exchanges to self-custody (without sounding preachy)
- How to explain keys, custody, and responsibility in plain language
- How to help a friend after a loss (support, not judgment)

### “Coping and next steps” resources (post-incident)
- What to do in the first 24 hours after a hack headline
- A calm checklist: verify facts, avoid scams, assess exposure, proceed in steps

### Evergreen decision support
- Exchange vs self-custody vs multisig (when each makes sense)
- A simple self-custody ladder (small → medium → large holdings)
- Tradeoffs: what self-custody solves and what it doesn’t

### Tooling roundups (ecosystem-friendly)
- “If you’re starting self-custody: the safest beginner set”
- “If you care about inheritance: questions to ask + options to compare”
- “If you travel a lot: operational security basics”
