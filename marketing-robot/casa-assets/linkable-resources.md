# Linkable resources (source of truth)

This file is a **link/CTA safety registry** for the content pipeline.

## Placeholder policy (proposed resources)

When a run requests a new resource that doesn’t exist yet (worksheet, checklist landing page), it must be:\n
- clearly labeled as **proposed** or **placeholder**\n
- expressed as a **path** (e.g., `/self-custody-check`) rather than a live URL\n
- included with **soft** CTA language (no urgency)

Recommended label formats:
- `/self-custody-check (proposed worksheet)`\n
- `/self-custody-check (placeholder link)`

## Allowed CTA style (CASA tone)

- Calm, informational, optional.\n
- No “move now,” no fear hooks, no dunking.\n
- Prefer: “If helpful…”, “We put together…”, “Here’s a 1-page…”

## Default CTA copy blocks (safe)

### Worksheet CTA (placeholder)

Use when `link_target_type=worksheet_placeholder`:\n
- “If helpful, we put together a 1-page self-custody check you can run in 10 minutes: `/self-custody-check (proposed worksheet)`”

### Checklist CTA (no link)

Use when link-outs are disabled:\n
- “If you want, reply ‘checklist’ and we’ll share a 1-page custody checklist.”

## Verified links

Only add a link here if it has been verified to exist.\n
