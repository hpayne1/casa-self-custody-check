# CASA Brand Voice (External + Our Spice)

This doc is a **working source of truth** for how CASA should sound in public: calm, credible, helpful, and never opportunistic—especially in crisis moments.

## One-line posture

**Verbatim (CASA homepage):** “Take control of your bitcoin. Forever.”

**Synthesized (averaged from site voice):** CASA helps you take control of your bitcoin and stablecoins with **onchain** self-custody vaults, inheritance planning, and personal expert support—delivered with first-class, Swiss-bank composure.

## Non-negotiables (always)

- **Lowercase “bitcoin”**: Always write `bitcoin`, not `Bitcoin`, unless quoting a proper noun.
- **No dunking. No schadenfreude.** No “we told you so,” no subtweets, no blame, no victim-shaming, no dogpiling.
- **Helpfulness first, sales second (often never).** In crisis: education + practical next steps. If there is a CTA, it’s soft and informational.
- **Factual restraint**: If we don’t know something, we say so. Avoid absolutes (“can’t be hacked,” “100% safe”).
- **Institutional calm**: steady, measured, composed. Treat the audience like adults with agency.
- **Emojis**: default **none**. If used at all, keep it rare (≤1) and never in crisis/security incidents.

## What we’re optimizing for

- **Trust**: credibility, accuracy, restraint, and empathy.
- **Clarity**: plain language, minimal jargon, scannable structure.
- **Practicality**: concrete next steps and decision frameworks.
- **Long-term authority**: we show up consistently as the reasonable counterpoint to “crypto writ large.”

## External perception (what CASA sounds like today)

Based on public site and blog:

- **Direct, accessible**: plain language; avoids unnecessary jargon.
- **Education-forward**: explains concepts (multisig / multi-key vaults) and why they matter.
- **Reassuring**: “peace of mind,” “you never have to go it alone.”
- **Mission-driven**: sovereignty, true ownership, long-term wealth protection.

## Our spice (what we want to amplify)

- **Swiss-bank composure**: less hype, fewer adjectives, more precision.
- **Validate → reframe → next step**: acknowledge the problem; calmly explain the principle; give 1–3 safe actions.
- **Decision support**: frameworks, checklists, “if-then” guidance (especially after incidents).
- **Empathy without drama**: acknowledge losses and stress; avoid sensationalism.
- **Ecosystem-friendly**: elevate best practices and tools across the space (Ahrefs-style authority).
- **Translate to familiar finance**: use “custody / counterparty risk / controls” analogies so non-crypto readers can follow.

## Our spice (what we want to reduce)

- **Overly promotional endings**: avoid tacking on a salesy paragraph after a serious post.
- **Hero narrative**: avoid framing CASA as the savior; focus on user agency and good practices.
- **Vague security claims**: replace with specific protections and tradeoffs.

## Vocabulary and style

- **Preferred**: “take control,” “peace of mind,” “own your bitcoin for real,” “no technical skill required,” “self-custody,” “multi-key vault,” “keys,” “recovery,” “custodial risk,” “counterparty risk,” “tradeoffs,” “inheritance plan,” “personal support,” “white-glove support.”
- **Avoid**: “unhackable,” “guaranteed,” “risk-free,” “rekt,” “cope,” “ngmi,” dunky memes in serious contexts.
- **Short sentences** when stakes are high.
- **Active voice** and **concrete verbs**.
- **Use non-crypto words first** when possible, then optionally map to crypto terms (e.g., “controls” → “keys/multisig”).

## X account voice rules (main vs personal)

- **CASA_main account** (institutional):\n  - No first-person singular (“I”, “my”).\n  - Prefer calm institutional language (you can use “CASA” explicitly).\n  - Avoid dunking, urgency CTAs, and speculation.\n- **Personal accounts** (CEO/Nick, Growth/Marketing):\n  - First-person is allowed.\n  - Should play off the main post (QT style), adding context or a specific takeaway.\n  - Must stay first-class: no dunking, no gloating, no hype.

## Crisis response posture (exchange hacks, failures, scams)

**Do**
- Lead with empathy: acknowledge fear, uncertainty, stress.
- Explain the principle (custody model) without naming/shaming.
- Give 1–3 practical next steps: “pause,” “verify,” “consider moving long-term holdings,” “learn the basics,” “test recovery.”
- Acknowledge tradeoffs: self-custody increases responsibility; it’s ok to take time.
- Write to **two states**:\n  - **Impacted / possibly-impacted** (withdrawals halted, funds uncertain): validate + scam avoidance + verification.\n  - **Not impacted** (spectators): calm custody framework + step-by-step next actions.\n  This prevents language that feels minimizing (“uneasy”) when people are actually harmed.

**B2B operator/custodian note (when relevant):**\nIf you choose to address operators (exchanges, custodians, treasury teams), keep it sober and non-judgmental.\n- Frame multisig, role separation, and multi-party approval as **risk reduction** and stronger internal controls—not a guarantee of prevention.\n- Avoid “this would have prevented it” language (we rarely know enough; security is a system).\n- Offer a soft invite to talk (first-class tone; no dunking).

**Don’t**
- Don’t use urgency CTAs (“move now”) or paid crisis keyword targeting.
- Don’t speculate about causes or blame.
- Don’t imply the victim “should have known better.”

## “First-class financial institution” checks (quick)

Before publishing, ask:
- **Does this provide value?**
  - Practical value: a clear next step, checklist, or decision framework.
  - Emotional value: validation, reassurance, reduced panic (without minimizing).
- **Would this read well on a WSJ screenshot?**
- **If quoted out of context, does it still sound fair?**
- **Is the first sentence empathetic and calm?**
- **Are we making claims we can’t substantiate?**
- **Are we offering a practical next step (not just commentary)?**

## Micro-briefs (persona guidance)

### CEO / Nick (Nick Neuman)
- **Mission and posture**: calm authority, long-term view, “security is a practice,” no theatrics. Principled, bitcoin-veteran energy.
- **Signature moves**:
  - Validate the emotion, then a simple custody reframe (“keys vs IOU”).
  - Treat custody as **counterparty risk**; self-custody as reducing reliance on third parties.
  - Acknowledge tradeoffs plainly (responsibility, key management) without scaring people.
  - Give 1–3 safe next steps; avoid overwhelming lists.
- **Anti-patterns**: dunking/schadenfreude, gloating, panic language, speculative blame, overly product-y in crisis, emojis.
- **Style**: concise, confident, measured. One metaphor max.
- **Example openers**:
  - “If you’re feeling uneasy today, that makes sense. Here’s what matters—and what you can do next.”
  - “Events like this are a reminder: convenience and custody are not the same thing.”
  - “An exchange account can be convenient—but it’s also counterparty risk. Here’s how to think about it.”

### Educational curator
- **Mission and posture**: practical teacher. “Here’s how it works” + “here’s a safe next step.” Uses traditional finance parallels before crypto jargon.
- **Signature moves**:
  - Explain in non-crypto terms first (custody, controls, recovery), then map to keys/multisig.
  - Analogies: “IOU vs ownership,” “two-person rule,” “dual control,” “vault access controls.”
  - Checklists and decision ladders (small → medium → large holdings).
  - Common mistakes and safe defaults (start small, test recovery).
- **Anti-patterns**: jargon dumps; too many options; implied judgment; memes; emojis in serious contexts.
- **Style**: structured, scannable, example-driven. Headings that read like questions.
- **Example openers**:
  - “Self-custody doesn’t have to be scary. Start with these three basics.”
  - “If you’ve only ever held bitcoin on an exchange, here’s the simplest mental model to understand what just happened.”
  - “Think of custody like who controls the vault—then we’ll translate that into keys and multisig.”

### Head of marketing (optional persona)
- **Mission and posture**: orchestrates clarity and consistency; ensures contract fit; ensures we’re helpful without being salesy.
- **Signature moves**:
  - Punchy hook or question that still reads first-class (no dunking, no hype).
  - Audience clarity (“If you’re holding long-term…”).
  - Strong structure; CTAs that match the moment (often none; or soft “learn more”).
- **Anti-patterns**: growth hacks in crisis; sensationalism; over-optimizing for engagement; emojis by default.

### General creator
- **Mission and posture**: narrative + clarity. Human, but never melodramatic.
- **Signature moves**: story framing; short scenes; crisp takeaway.
- **Anti-patterns**: cynicism, dunking, vibes without guidance.

## Examples (quick)

### X post (good)
“If you’re stressed after today’s exchange news, you’re not alone.\n\nThe core issue is custody: when someone else holds the keys, you’re holding an IOU.\n\nIf you’re thinking about self-custody, start small—learn the basics, then move at your own pace.”

### X post (bad)
“Told you so. Not your keys, not your coins. Move everything off exchanges NOW.”

### Blog tone (good)
- Calm headline, clear structure, neutral language, explicit tradeoffs, practical steps, soft CTA or no CTA.

### Blog tone (bad)
- Fear-driven framing, speculative blame, or a sales pitch tacked onto a serious incident.
