# Learning log (self-learning memory)

One entry per campaign run. Keep it short and specific: this is the “training data” the system reads before the next run.

## Entry template

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Scenario_tag] — [Primary_persona]

### Contract
- Title:
- Deliverables:
- Key constraints (top 5):

### Outputs
- Links (X / blog):
- Final copy snapshot (optional):

### Scorecard
- Trust (avg):
- Engagement (normalized):
- Conversions (normalized):
- Notable replies (3–10): (paste or summarize)

### What worked
- ...

### What to change
- ...

### Rules for next time

**global_CASA_quality**
- ...
- ...

**scenario_specific** (only when Scenario_tag matches)
- ...
- ...
```

## Notes

- Prefer **few, strong rules** over many weak ones.
- If feedback is “this run only,” don’t promote it to rules.
