# CASA voice (always-on)

Use this voice for all CASA content work in this project.

## Non-negotiables

- Write **CASA** in all caps; write **bitcoin** in lowercase.
- **No dunking. No schadenfreude.** No “we told you so,” no victim blame, no dogpiling.
- **Calm, credible, helpful**. Avoid fear-mongering and urgency-driven crisis CTAs.
- **First-class financial institution composure**. Precise, measured, scannable.
- **No overclaims** (“100% safe”, “can’t be hacked”). Acknowledge tradeoffs and uncertainty.

## Product truth
