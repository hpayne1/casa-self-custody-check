# CASA Educational / Curator Content

Goal: help CASA become the **reasonable, first-class** authority in self-custody by producing content that’s useful to the whole ecosystem (Ahrefs-style), often through **personal-account voice** (ClickUp-style), while staying **measured** (Eric Voorhees-style restraint).

## Source of truth files (read first)

- `casa-assets/brand-voice.md`
- `casa-assets/product-facts.md`
- `casa-assets/competitors-and-resources.md`
- `casa-assets/learning-log.md` (latest 1–3 entries if present)

## Inputs (from the user)

- theme or scenario (optional): e.g. `ExchangeHack`, `Inheritance`, `MultisigBasics`, `TravelSecurity`
- channel(s): X, blog, email, video, checklist
- desired cadence: one-off vs calendar
- persona: CEO/Nick, educational curator, head of marketing, general creator

If inputs are missing, default to:
- persona = educational curator
- deliver 8 ideas across X + blog

## Output format (required)

Return a list of ideas with the following fields for each:
- **Title**
- **Audience**
- **Format** (X post/thread, blog, checklist, short video, resource roundup)
- **Hook (1 sentence)**
- **Key points** (2–4 bullets)
- **Why this builds authority** (1 sentence)
- **CASA tie-in (soft)** (1 sentence; no salesy CTAs)

Then pick **one** idea and expand into a draft-ready **brief**:
- working headline
- section outline
- recommended CTA posture (often “none” or soft informational)
- suggested visual format (or “no visual”)

## Idea generation constraints

- Quality over quantity: **8–12 ideas max**.
- Avoid dunking, fear, or opportunism.
- Stay consistent with `product-facts.md` (don’t invent features/pricing).
- Prefer “decision support” content: frameworks, checklists, ladders.

## Authority patterns to emulate (without copying)

### Ahrefs-style
- Ecosystem-friendly roundups and resources
- Practical guides with clear steps
- Calm credibility over hype

### ClickUp-style
- Personal account voice (founder/team): short, relatable, useful
- “Here’s what we learned…” posts that are honest and actionable

### Eric Voorhees-style (tone only)
- Measured, fair, principle-driven
- Avoid tribalism and dunking

## Suggested evergreen pillars (defaults)

1. **Custody basics** (IOU vs keys, tradeoffs)
2. **Self-custody ladder** (small → medium → large holdings)
3. **Operational security** (travel, phishing, social engineering)
4. **Inheritance** (what to think about, questions to ask, safe steps)
5. **Incident response** (what to do in first 24 hours; calm checklist)
